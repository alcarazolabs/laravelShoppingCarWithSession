# LaravelShoppingcart Demo
A small demo project for the [LaravelShoppingcart](https://github.com/bumbummen99/LaravelShoppingcart) package.

This project can be setup as usual for Laravel projects, just copy the .env file example and migrate the database. This is a bare bone project with Laravel Auth & LaravelShoppingcart so there are no special dependencies except of a HTTP-Server, MySQL and PHP.
